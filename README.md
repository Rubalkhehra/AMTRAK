# AMTRAK
Amtrak Ridership Forecasting and Time Series Analysis

## Tools & Technologies: 
Python, pandas, statsmodels, scikit-learn, SARIMAX, Random Forest, Holt-Winters, Tableau, Matplotlib

## Description:
Analyzed and forecasted Amtrak ridership data (1991â€“2000) using advanced time series modeling techniques.  
Preprocessing: Applied pd.to_datetime for timestamp conversion and visualized data trends using pandas and Matplotlib.  
Smoothing: Implemented moving averages to identify seasonal and long-term patterns.  
Stationarity: Utilized Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests and differencing to make the data stationary.  

## Modeling & Forecasting:
Built statistical models such as Holt-Winters Smoothing and SARIMA for trend and seasonality-based forecasting.  
Applied Random Forest Regressor to predict future values using a supervised learning approach.  

## Results: 
Improved forecasting accuracy by combining statistical models and machine learning techniques, achieving precise predictions for a 12-month test dataset.
